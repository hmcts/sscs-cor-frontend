Crafted objects passed to the `renderSync` function may trigger C++ assertions in `CustomImporterBridge::get_importer_entry` and `CustomImporterBridge::post_process_return_value` that crash the Node process. This may allow attackers to crash the system's running Node process and lead to Denial of Service.","recommendation":"No fix is currently available.
