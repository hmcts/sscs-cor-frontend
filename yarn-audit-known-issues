Impact\n\nVersions of Express.js prior to 4.19.2 and pre-release alpha and beta versions before 5.0.0-beta.3 are affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs.\n\nWhen a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL Express performs an encode [using `encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"},"1097147":{"findings":[{"version":"2.1.2","paths":["superagent>formidable","@hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck>superagent>formidable"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<3.2.4","module_name":"formidable","severity":"critical","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-8cp3-66vr-3r4c","cves":["CVE-2022-29622"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=3.2.4","cvss":{"score":9.8,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"updated":"2024-04-22T23:07:51.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 3.2.4 or later","cwe":["CWE-434"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097147,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29622\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6QPKooxhAo\n- https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/issues/856\n- https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/pull/857\n- https://gitlab.com/keymandll/blog/-/blob/master/posts/03062022-Invulnerability_Analysis-CVE-2022%E2%80%9329622/index.md\n- https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/researcher-defends-formidable-in-fight-against-critical-cve-vulnerability-assignment\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8cp3-66vr-3r4c","created":"2022-05-17T00:01:45.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Formidable arbitrary file upload","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"Disputed: An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in formidable v3.1.4 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted filename.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8cp3-66vr-3r4c"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":4,"high":0,"critical":2},"dependencies":349,"devDependencies":102,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":451}}
